# Problem Statement

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to develop a data science solution for accurately predicting used car prices. The analysis will leverage a diverse dataset obtained from CarDekho, encompassing key factors such as car model, number of owners, age, mileage, fuel type, kilometers driven, features, and location. The ultimate goal is to construct a machine learning model that enables users to determine current valuations for used cars.

## Data Understanding
The dataset comprises multiple Excel files, with each file representing a specific city. Columns in each Excel file offer a comprehensive overview of each car, including details, specifications, and available features.
